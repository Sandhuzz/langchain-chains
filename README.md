From Inputs → To Outputs → With Power of Chains.

This repository demonstrates LangChain Chains, a fundamental concept in LangChain that allows you to combine multiple components into a single workflow. Instead of calling models or tools one by one, Chains let you orchestrate prompts, models, retrievers, and functions into a seamless pipeline.

# 🌟 What Are Chains?

A Chain is a sequence of steps, where the output of one component becomes the input to the next.
They are the glue that binds together:

📄 Prompts → Structured inputs for models

🧠 LLMs → The reasoning engines

🔍 Retrievers → Fetch relevant information

🛠 Tools / Custom Functions → Extend workflows with custom logic

# ✨ Why Use Chains?

🔗 Orchestration → Easily connect multiple steps

🚀 Efficiency → Automate repetitive sequences

🔄 Reusability → Reuse the same chain across different applications

🌍 Flexibility → Mix and match models, retrievers, tools

# 🌍 Example Use Cases

🤖 Chatbots → Multi-turn conversations with context retention

📚 RAG Pipelines → Combine retrievers + LLMs for knowledge-based answers

📝 Document Summarization → Chain preprocessing → summarization → formatting

🎯 Decision-Making Agents → Link multiple tools and reasoning steps
